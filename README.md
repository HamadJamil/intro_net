# **IntroNet - Social Network Friend Recommendation System**

## 🚀 Project Overview

IntroNet is a social network application that leverages graph theory to model user relationships and provide insightful social recommendations. Each user is represented as a node in a graph, with friendships represented as edges connecting these nodes. The system offers several key functionalities such as mutual friends, friend recommendations, and a real-time user feed, similar to features commonly found on popular social media platforms.

🧠 **IntroNet** is a project developed to implement and demonstrate knowledge gained from the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course.


## 📌 Key Features

- **Add Friends**: Allows users to create new friendships within the network.
- **Delete Friends**: Lets users break existing friendships.
- **Display Mutual Friends**: Helps users find mutual friends they share with another user.
- **Suggest Potential Friends**: Recommends friends based on common friends-of-friends.
- **User Posting System**: Lets users create posts that are stored and displayed in a **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** manner, simulating a real-time activity feed.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **JavaFX**: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for development.
- **Java**: The primary programming language for the application logic.
- **MySQL**: Persistent data storage (e.g., user details, friendships, and posts).
- **GitHub**: Used for version control and project management.

## 🔗 Graph Theory Concepts

- **Nodes**: Each user is represented as a node.
- **Edges**: Friendships are represented by edges connecting nodes.
- **Degree of a Node**: The number of friendships a user has is equivalent to the degree of the corresponding node.
- **Mutual Friends**: Users who share common friends (i.e., common edges).
- **Friends of Friends**: Friend recommendations based on mutual friends (2-step connections).

## 🔄 Flow and Operations

### 1. **User Registration and Authentication**:

- Users can sign up with a unique **username**, **email**, and **password**.
- After signing up, users can log in using their credentials.

### 2. **User Interactions**:

Once logged in, users can:
- Access their **profile**.
- Manage **friendships** (add/remove).
- View **mutual friends** with other users.
- Create **posts** that are displayed in a **queue-based system** (First-Come, First-Served).

### 3. **Friend Recommendations**:

- The system suggests **friends-of-friends** based on shared connections in the graph, helping users expand their social circles.

## 🗃️ Database

**MySQL** can be used to store user data, including:
- **Users**: Store user credentials, profile details, and friendships.
- **Posts**: Store user-generated content.
- **Friendships**: Track relationships as edges in the graph.
